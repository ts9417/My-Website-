## Installation

### CocoaPods

SwiftChart is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftChart"
```

### Manually

1. Download **SwiftChart.zip** from the [last release](https://github.com/gpbl/SwiftChart/releases/latest) and extract its content in your project's folder.
2. From the Xcode project, choose *Add Files to <ProjectName>...* from the *File* menu and add the extracted files.

## Usage

The library includes:

- the [Chart](Source/Chart.swift#L40) main class, to initialize and configure the chart‚Äôs content, e.g. for adding series or setting up the its appearance
- the [ChartSeries](Source/ChartSeries.swift) class, for creating datasets and configure their appearance
- the [ChartDelegate](Source/Chart.swift#L10-L32) protocol, which tells other objects about the chart‚Äôs touch events
- the [ChartColor](Source/ChartColors.swift) struct, containing some predefined colors

**Example**

```swift
let chart = Chart()
let series = ChartSeries([0, 6, 2, 8, 4, 7, 3, 10, 8])
series.color = ChartColors.greenColor()
chart.add(series)
```

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

### To initialize a chart
